/**
 * @brief Stateful oscillator producing Const/Sin/Cos/Square/Saw/Triangle/FastSin/FastCos waveforms.
 *
 * Sin/Cos call std::sin/std::cos per sample (high precision, no drift).
 * FastSin/FastCos use a recursive phasor rotation (one complex multiply per sample,
 * ~10x faster, re-seeded from an exact phase on a fixed cadence to bound drift).
 * output(t) = A * waveform(2*pi*f*t + phase) + O.
 * frequency <= 0 is coerced to Const at configure time.
 *
 * Time is a sample count and never a running float. An accumulator holding elapsed seconds in the value type
 * loses the tick as soon as its ULP approaches it: at F = float and 1 MS/s the 1e-6 s tick already rounds to
 * 9.5367e-7 s at t = 1 s, so the tone reads 953.674 Hz instead of 1 kHz; past 16.777 s the tick rounds to
 * 1.9073e-6 s and the tone doubles; and at t = 32 s the tick is below half an ULP, the accumulator stands
 * still, and every waveform that reads it freezes on DC. A sample count has none of that: it is exact, and
 * the instant is formed from it at the point of use.
 *
 * That instant is a phase reduced to one cycle, and it is reduced in fixed point because there the reduction
 * is free: the cycles per sample are held as Q64 cycles, the product with the sample count is exact, and the
 * whole cycles leave in the wrap of the 64-bit multiply rather than in a subtraction that would first have to
 * form -- and then cancel -- a number the size of the run. Two error terms follow from that, and neither is
 * an accumulation. The step is the requested ratio rounded to a Q64 cycle, so the frequency it realizes is
 * within 2^-65 cycles/sample of f/fs -- the quotient is taken as a two-part double, one fused multiply-add
 * recovering what the division dropped, so the rounding is of the ratio itself and not of its nearest double,
 * which for f/fs above 2^-12 puts the step nearer the request than a double can express it. The phase at
 * sample n is then exact from that step, and only its conversion to double rounds: under 2^-55 cycles, or
 * 1.7e-16 rad, at every index. What is left is the departure from the ideal rational, n * 2^-65 cycles: one
 * ULP at 2*pi after 4096 samples, 5.1e-12 rad over the 30 s at 1 MS/s the qa runs, 1.5e-8 rad over a day of
 * it and 1.5e-3 rad over 285 years of it. The transcendental is evaluated in F, so F = float rounds the
 * argument once more, to 2.4e-7 rad; that is the floor the Phasor's re-seed carries as well, and it likewise
 * does not grow with stream length.
