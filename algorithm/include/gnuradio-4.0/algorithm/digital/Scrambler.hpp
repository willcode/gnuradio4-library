/**
 * @brief The two scrambler families over GF(2), from one register definition and three recursions.
 *
 * A scrambler is a shift register of `degree` bits and a set of feedback delays. For a bit stream
 * `b` the feedback at position `k` is `f(b, k) = XOR over j in taps of b[k - j]`, and that is the
 * only expression here. The three modes differ in which stream the register holds and in nothing
 * else:
 *
 * - `Additive` runs `s[k] = f(s, k)` and emits `in[k] XOR s[k]`, so the register holds the
 *   generator's own past output and the sequence is a function of the taps and the seed alone.
 *   Error multiplication is exactly one and the whitening does not depend on the data, but the two
 *   ends must agree on the phase: one bit of phase error leaves the descrambled stream agreeing
 *   with the truth at chance.
 * - `MultiplicativeScramble` runs `out[k] = in[k] XOR f(out, k)`, so the register holds the block's
 *   own past output.
 * - `MultiplicativeDescramble` runs `out[k] = in[k] XOR f(in, k)`, so the register holds the past
 *   input. Every bit in it is received data once `degree` bits have arrived, so the output is
 *   correct from position `degree` onward whatever the register started as, from any offset into
 *   the stream. The price is error multiplication of `1 + tapCount` and a data-dependent failure
 *   mode: an input chosen as `in[k] = f(out, k)` holds the scrambled output at a constant for as
 *   long as it continues, from any seed.
 *
 * The two multiplicative modes invert each other exactly from position zero when both registers
 * start from the same `degree` bits, and `Additive` is its own inverse.
 *
 * **Taps are delays, not exponents.** A three-term feedback polynomial is written both as a
 * characteristic polynomial `x^n + x^m + 1`, whose recursion is `s[k] = s[k-(n-m)] XOR s[k-n]` and
 * whose written exponents are not delays, and as a delay-operator polynomial `1 + X^m + X^n`, whose
 * written exponents are delays. The two readings give reciprocal delay sets and therefore
 * time-reversed sequences, and the standards do not agree on which reading their spelling means:
 * CCSDS 131.0-B's `x^8 + x^7 + x^5 + x^3 + 1` is characteristic, giving delays `{1,3,5,8}`, while
 * IEEE 802.11's `x^7 + x^4 + 1` is a delay reading, giving `{4,7}`. Each is confirmed by the
 * sequence its own standard publishes. `TapMask` therefore carries delays and nothing else, and the
 * named constants below carry the reading that reproduces the published check value.
 *
 * **The output tap is not a parameter.** Reading a different stage of a Fibonacci register shifts
 * the sequence's phase by a fixed number of steps and nothing else, and a phase shift is a seed. One
 * convention is fixed here: the seed supplies `degree` bits, leftmost first, in time order. Under
 * `Additive` those are the first `degree` bits of the sequence; under the two multiplicative modes
 * they are the `degree` bits assumed to precede the stream, oldest first. Both readings pack into
 * `seed` the same way, leftmost into the most significant of the `degree` significant bits.
 *
 * An item is `BitPacking.hpp`'s item: a `std::uint8_t` carrying `bitsPerItem` significant bits in
 * its low positions, whose stream order inside the item is `MsbFirst` or `LsbFirst`. Bits above
 * `bitsPerItem` are masked away on input and left zero on output, so no stream value can fail.
 * `BitOrder` is that header's enumeration rather than a second one with the same two members.
 *
 * `configure()` validates, derives everything the sample path indexes, and is the only function here
 * that can throw. It throws `std::invalid_argument`, not a graph exception, because this header
 * depends on the standard library alone. `scramble()` and `reset()` are `noexcept`, allocate
 * nothing, and hold no state beyond the configuration they are handed.
 *
 * Three shapes carry the sample path, one per mode, and they differ because the data dependence
 * differs. `Additive`'s sequence does not depend on the data at all, so it is generated for a whole
 * chunk before an input bit is read and the scrambling proper is an XOR over two spans; the sequence
 * comes either from a bit table of one full period, built in `configure()` for `degree <= 16` and at
 * most 8193 bytes, or from a recurrence that produces `min(8, minDelay)` bits per branch-free step,
 * since no bit produced within such a step is needed by that same step. `MultiplicativeScramble`
 * reads its own output and takes the same stepped form at a loop-carried depth of `minDelay`.
 * `MultiplicativeDescramble` reads only its input, so it has no loop-carried dependency whatever:
 * at eight bits per item it is a shifted-span XOR over a rolling 64-bit window of received bits,
 * `tapCount` shifts and XORs per byte. `detail::scrambleReference()` is the bit-at-a-time definition
 * all of them are measured against; every form leaves identical state, so they are interchangeable
 * at any item boundary.
 *
 * Two things a published agreement can fix that a recursion cannot are here as well. A **profile** is
 * a name for the four settings the generator is built from — taps, seed, item width and bit order —
 * and for the family they belong to, so a self-synchronizing agreement cannot be run additively by
 * accident; it is never a default and it names nothing else. An **explicit sequence** is a mask the
 * caller supplies outright instead of walking a recursion for it, which is what most vendor whitening
 * is published as; it is the table form with the table handed over, so it costs the same per item and
 * changes no other behavior.
 *
 * The multiplicative pair also carries an output inversion and a forced-transition rule, off by
 * default and dispatched to rather than folded in. Both are stated at `configureMonitor()`, including
 * the run-length bound the rule cannot give: the pair stays a bijection on bit streams, so no property
 * of the output holds over all inputs, and what it does give is a firing bound and the destruction of
 * the plain recursion's lock-up input.

 * @brief Adds the output inversion and the forced-transition rule to a configured multiplicative scrambler or descrambler.
 *
 * Written out, with `y` the transmitted stream, `f(y,k)` the feedback over the tap delays and `v` the inversion:
 * `F[k] = 1` exactly when the counter reads `N - 1`; the scrambler emits `y[k] = v XOR x[k] XOR f(y,k) XOR F[k]` and
 * the descrambler recovers `x[k] = v XOR y[k] XOR f(y,k) XOR F[k]`; then both compute `d = y[k-p] XOR y[k-q]` and set
 * the counter to zero if `d` is one and to `(c + 1) mod N` otherwise.
 *
 * **The monitor reads only the transmitted stream**, which is the whole reason the rule stays invertible: both ends see
 * `y`, so both compute the same counter and the same `F[k]` with no side channel, and the descrambler is still exactly
 * the scrambler's inverse. What follows from that is also what the rule cannot promise — the pair is a bijection on bit
 * streams, so for every output, the constant one included, there is exactly one input producing it, and no property of
 * the output is guaranteed over all inputs. What the rule does guarantee is that the block never emits `N` consecutive
 * items over which the monitored comparison is zero without injecting a complement at the `N`-th, and that the plain
 * recursion's lock-up input no longer holds the output at a constant.
 *
 * @p forceAfter is `N`, in `[2, 4096]`, or zero to disable the rule entirely; @p monitorDelays names `p` and `q` as two
 * distinct decimal delays in the spelling `tapsFromDelayList` reads, and is required when `N` is non-zero and refused
 * when it is zero, since a setting describing a disabled mechanism is a settings error rather than a no-op. Call this
