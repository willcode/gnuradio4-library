/**
 * @brief Pulse-position framing: a burst read out of magnitude samples with no clock and no carrier to acquire.
 *
 * Pulse-position modulation carries one pulse per bit period, in the first half of the period for a one and in the
 * second for a zero, so a bit is decided by comparing the two halves of one period with each other. Nothing is
 * carried in phase, no amplitude has to be tracked, and the comparison is scale free — which is why a burst that
 * arrives out of noise, with nothing before it and nothing after it, needs no synchronization at all. The scanner
 * here is therefore a window that slides one sample at a time and decides each position on its own.
 *
 * A framing is a `PpmConfig`: which of the preamble's half-period slots carry a pulse, how many slots the preamble
 * spans, how many leading bits select the frame length, the two lengths, and the parity field's CRC six-tuple.
 * `modeS()` is the ICAO Annex 10 Volume IV reply format as a value of it. The config is an interoperability
 * constant rather than a default, so a scanner without one is inert.
 *
 * Every position is decided exactly once and its decision reads a fixed window after it, so the result does not
 * depend on how the input was chunked. `consume()` decides every position whose whole window lies inside the span
 * it was given and returns how many samples it is done with; the caller presents the remainder again, prefixed to
 * whatever arrived next. Nothing here allocates after `prepare()` except the slot-sum scratch, which grows once to
 * the largest span it has been shown.
 *
 * The parity is checked here rather than downstream because the remainder decides containment: an admitted frame
 * hides the positions inside it, and only a frame the parity vouches for may do that. The remainder travels on
 * every reported frame, so nothing is thrown away by checking early — for the Mode S formats that transmit the
 * parity XOR'd with an address, the remainder *is* that address.

 * A nomination reads the format field, takes the frame length from it, packs the bits into octets and computes the
