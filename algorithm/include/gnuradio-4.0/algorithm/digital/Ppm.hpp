/**
 * @brief Pulse-position framing: a burst read out of magnitude samples with no clock and no carrier to acquire.
 *
 * Pulse-position modulation carries one pulse per bit period, in the first half of the period for a one and in the
 * second for a zero, so a bit is decided by comparing the two halves of one period with each other. Nothing is
 * carried in phase, no amplitude has to be tracked, and the comparison is scale free — which is why a burst that
 * arrives out of noise, with nothing before it and nothing after it, needs no synchronization at all. The scanner
 * here is therefore a window that slides one sample at a time and decides each position on its own.
 *
 * A framing is a `PpmConfig`: which of the preamble's half-period slots carry a pulse, how many slots the preamble
 * spans, how many leading bits select the frame length, the two lengths, and the parity field's CRC six-tuple.
 * `modeS()` is the ICAO Annex 10 Volume IV reply format as a value of it. The config is an interoperability
 * constant rather than a default, so a scanner without one is inert.
 *
 * Every position is decided exactly once and its decision reads a fixed window after it, so the result does not
 * depend on how the input was chunked. `consume()` decides every position whose whole window lies inside the span
 * it was given and returns how many samples it is done with; the caller presents the remainder again, prefixed to
 * whatever arrived next. Nothing here allocates after `prepare()` except the slot-sum scratch, which grows once to
 * the largest span it has been shown.
 *
 * A position is an integer sample index, but a burst does not arrive on the sample clock: a pulse straddling two
 * samples splits its energy over both, and at one sample a slot the half that lands in the neighboring gap slot is
 * the very quantity the shape test measures the pulses against. The scanner therefore takes the complex samples as
 * well, when a caller has them, and decides each position at the sub-sample offset its preamble actually sits on —
 * a cheap test at integer positions to find candidates, then a search over `phaseSteps` offsets spanning one
 * sample, on magnitudes interpolated by `gr::sync::MmseInterpolatorBank`. The offset that wins decides the bits too,
 * and travels on the frame as `phase`. With no samples, or with `phaseSteps` at one, every decision is the integer
 * one and nothing is interpolated.
 *
 * The parity is checked here rather than downstream because the remainder decides containment: an admitted frame
 * hides the positions inside it, and only a frame the parity vouches for may do that. The remainder travels on
 * every reported frame, so nothing is thrown away by checking early — for the Mode S formats that transmit the
 * parity XOR'd with an address, the remainder *is* that address.

/**
 * @brief The pulse-position scanner: a shape test at every position, and a frame read out of the ones that pass.
 *
 * A slot's strength is the mean magnitude over its `samplesPerSlot()` samples, and the shape test compares the
 * *least* of the pulse slots with the *greatest* of the gaps. Taking the extremes on both sides makes it a test of
 * shape and not of energy: one loud sample cannot buy a nomination for a position whose other pulses are absent.
 * Because every slot averages the same number of samples, the test and the bit decisions are made on the sums
 * directly and the division by the slot width is done only for what is reported.
 *
 * A nomination reads the format field, takes the frame length from it, packs the bits into octets and computes the
 * whole frame's remainder. A long frame with a zero remainder is admitted and consumes its whole window, so no
 * position inside it is nominated; every other nomination advances the search by one sample. That asymmetry is
 * what the parity buys, and it is the reason a false nomination one sample before a real preamble cannot swallow
 * the real frame.
 *
 * Given the complex samples the magnitudes were taken from, the decision splits in two. The integer test runs at
 * `threshold * coarseRatio` and only selects candidates; each candidate is then measured again at every one of
 * `phaseSteps` offsets spanning one sample, on magnitudes interpolated from the complex samples, and the offset
 * with the greatest ratio has to reach the full `threshold` for the position to be a nomination. Splitting it this
 * way is what makes the search affordable: the coarse test is the same handful of comparisons per position it
 * always was, and the interpolation runs only where a preamble might be. The relaxed coarse threshold is what a
 * badly timed preamble needs to survive to the search, because half a pulse landing in a gap slot both lowers the
 * pulses and raises the gaps.
 *
 * An even `phaseSteps` puts a zero offset in the set, and an interpolation at zero is a unit impulse, so one of the
 * offsets tried reproduces the integer decision exactly. The search therefore never reports a smaller ratio than
 * the integer test would have, and never refuses a position the integer test at the same `threshold` would have
 * taken. What it buys is bounded by how much of the burst survives the sample rate: a pulse one slot wide at one
 * sample a slot is an impulse, its spectrum reaches past Nyquist, and no interpolation recovers the peak a straddled
 * pulse split in two — the ratio rises but not to what good timing gives. Two slots of pulse per sample, which is
 * what three samples a slot gives, is where the search recovers the whole of it.
