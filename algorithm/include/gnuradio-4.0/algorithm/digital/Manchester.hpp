/**
 * @brief The Manchester line code, both live conventions, from one XOR constant.
 *
 * One data bit becomes two chips of opposite value. Writing the convention as a constant `k` in
 * GF(2), the whole code is one line:
 *
 *     chipPair(b) = (b XOR k, b XOR k XOR 1)
 *
 * so there is a transition at the center of every bit, the running disparity returns to zero at every
 * bit boundary, no more than two like chips ever occur in a row, and the chip rate is twice the bit
 * rate. None of that depends on the data, on a seed or on any state.
 *
 * `k` is the whole of the difference between the two conventions in use. `Ieee8023` is `k = 1`: IEEE
 * Std 802.3's 10 Mbit/s PLS carries the complement of the data bit in the first half of the bit cell
 * and the true bit in the second, so a mid-bit low-to-high transition is a one and a zero encodes to
 * the chips `10`. `GeThomas` is `k = 0`: MIL-STD-1553 states the chip pair itself, a logic one as a
 * positive pulse followed by a negative one and a logic zero as its inverse, so a one encodes to `10`.
 * The two are exact chipwise complements — `chipPair` under one convention is the bitwise complement
 * of the other's — and that is the trap the required setting exists for: **a stream read under the
 * wrong convention decodes to the exact bitwise complement of the data with no violation raised
 * anywhere**, so nothing short of a downstream CRC can tell. There is no defensible default.
 *
 * The decoder is the same line read backwards, and the rule is uniform:
 *
 *     bit       = c0 XOR k
 *     violation = NOT (c0 XOR c1)
 *
 * The decoded bit comes from the first chip alone; the second chip only sets the flag. On a valid
 * pair that is the same answer as any other reading, since `c1 = NOT c0` there. On a chip pair of
 * `00` or `11` — which the encoder cannot produce, and which MIL-STD-1553's syncs and IEEE 802.5's
 * `J`/`K` delimiters are on purpose — it is a stated convention, it removes the only branch the
 * decoder would otherwise have, and it makes `(bit, violation)` a lossless recoding of the chip pair:
 * the chips were `(bit XOR k, bit XOR k XOR 1)` when the flag is clear and `(bit XOR k, bit XOR k)`
 * when it is set. Nothing is dropped, corrected, or resynchronized on, because a decoder that
 * realigned itself on a violation would fail hardest on the protocols that use violations as data.
 *
 * A 2:1 decoder also has to decide which chip starts a pair. `gridParity` is that decision and one
 * bit is the whole of it: `0` pairs chips `(0,1), (2,3), …` and holds nothing between calls, `1`
 * pairs `(1,2), (3,4), …` and holds exactly one chip. `realign()` moves it, and each direction costs
 * exactly one chip: moving to `1` emits the chip at the boundary as a flagged orphan, moving to `0`
 * drops the held chip. That asymmetry is forced rather than chosen — it is the only assignment that
 * keeps the decoder exactly one output item per two input items in both directions. A decoder one
 * chip out of phase is loud in proportion to the data's transition density and completely silent on a
 * constant stream, where it produces the complement of the data: the wrong-convention symptom
 * exactly, which is the second reason the convention is not guessed.
 *
 * An item is `BitPacking.hpp`'s item: a `std::uint8_t` carrying `bitsPerItem` significant bits in its
 * low positions, whose stream order inside the item is `MsbFirst` or `LsbFirst`. Bits above
 * `bitsPerItem` are masked away on input and left zero on output, so no stream value can fail.
 * `BitOrder` is that header's enumeration rather than a second one with the same two members. One
 * input item of `bitsPerItem` bits becomes exactly two output items of `bitsPerItem` chips for every
 * width, so the ratio does not move with the width; at odd widths a single bit's two chips fall on
 * either side of the boundary between those two items, which is the same statement about the chip
 * stream and not a special case.
 *
 * `configure()` validates, derives `k`, builds the encoder's chip table and calls `reset()`. It is
 * the only function here that can throw. It throws `std::invalid_argument`, not a graph exception,
 * because this header depends on the standard library alone. `encode()` is `const` on the
 * configuration and carries no state whatever; `decode()` is the only stateful entry and its state is
 * one chip; both are `noexcept` and allocate nothing.
 *
 * Two shapes carry the sample path. Encoding is a pure function of the input item, so `configure()`
 * resolves it into a 512-byte table of the two output items, and the sample path is one indexed load
 * and two stores with the field mask already folded in. Decoding is bit-parallel and has no
 * loop-carried dependency: gathering the even chip positions of an item pair into `E` and the odd into
 * `O` gives the decoded field as `E XOR k` and the flags as `NOT (E XOR O)` in three operations for a
 * whole item, so the fast form runs whenever the grid is aligned and no chip is held.
 * `detail::encodeReference()` and `detail::decodeReference()` are the bit-at-a-time definitions both
 * are measured against; they agree bit for bit and leave identical state, so either can be deleted if
 * a benchmark says it is not worth its lines.
