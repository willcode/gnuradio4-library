/**
 * @brief The symbol phase of a burst, measured from the tone an alternating training sequence leaves.
 *
 * A two-level training sequence of alternating symbols, seen through an FM discriminator, is a real
 * tone at half the symbol rate: with `a_m = (-1)^m` the discriminator's output is the symbol pulse
 * `g` driven by a square wave of period two symbols, so it is periodic with `2*sps` samples and its
 * fundamental sits at
 *
 * ```
 * f0 = 1 / (2 * samplesPerSymbol)          cycles per sample
 * ```
 *
 * The frequency being known, the phase of that tone *is* the symbol phase, and one complex dot
 * product measures it — no loop, no acquisition transient, and an accuracy at the Cramer-Rao bound
 * for a real tone in Gaussian noise.
 *
 * Three responsibilities, and the split between the first two is the whole design:
 *
 * 1. `push` runs a sliding single-bin DFT and returns the fraction of the window's energy lying in
 *    the `f0` bin. It is `O(1)` a sample, by the recursion
 *    `S <- exp(j*w) * (S - v[n-N+1]) + v[n+1] * exp(-j*w*(N-1))`, which sits on the unit circle and
 *    so accumulates rounding without bound. Its only job is to decide *where* to fit.
 * 2. `fit` is an `O(N)` dot product over one named window and is what an estimate is taken from, so
 *    the recursion's drift never reaches a caller's answer.
 * 3. `instantAfter` turns a fitted phase into the symbol lattice, once, so no caller re-derives the
 *    sign.
 *
 * The statistic. Over a window of `N` samples with `X = (2/N) * sum_k v[k] * exp(-j*2*pi*f0*k)`,
 *
 * ```
 * Lambda = (N/2) * |X|^2 / sum_k v[k]^2
 * ```
 *
 * is the fraction of the window's energy in the `f0` bin: one on a pure tone, and invariant to the
 * stream's scale, so a threshold on it needs no AGC and no absolute level. Under `N` samples of
 * Gaussian noise `Lambda` is the ratio of one of `N/2` independent periodogram bins to their sum, so
 * it is `Beta(1, N/2 - 1)` with mean `2/N` and `P(Lambda > t) = (1-t)^(N/2-1)` — which is what turns
 * a wanted false-alarm rate into a threshold.
 *
 * The lattice. The symbol instants are the tone's extrema, `2*pi*f0*(n - n0) + phi = k*pi`, so with
 * `1/(2*f0) = sps`
 *
 * ```
 * n = n0 + (k - phi/pi) * sps            k integer
 * ```
 *
 * and the offset from the window's first sample to an instant is `-(phi/pi)*sps` reduced modulo
 * `sps`. It is positive toward later samples, which is the sense a `time_est` tag carries.
