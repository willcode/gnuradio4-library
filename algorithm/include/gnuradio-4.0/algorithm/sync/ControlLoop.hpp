/**
 * @brief The second-order tracking loop shared by the synchronizers: carrier PLL, Costas loop,
 * band-edge FLL and symbol clock recovery, written once, with the detector left outside.
 *
 * Those loops differ in their error detector and in nothing else. The recursion is shared, and the
 * recursion is where the errors are: gains that cannot be derived from the parameter they were
 * given, a phase wrap written as a `while` loop, a frequency clamp applied in the wrong place. One
 * step is
 *
 * ```
 * frequency += beta * error                         the integrator arm
 * frequency  = clamp(frequency, minFreq, maxFreq)   before the proportional arm is added
 * instant    = frequency + alpha * error            returned, never stored
 * phase      = wrap(phase + instant)                once per step, constant time
 * ```
 *
 * Four properties of that ordering matter. The clamp sits on the integrator arm alone,
 * immediately after it is updated: that is what stops integral windup, and clamping the phase
 * increment instead lets the integrator run away behind a limited output and take an unbounded time
 * to return. `instant` is the sum of both arms and is what the phase advanced by; a timing loop
 * reads it as the instantaneous clock period, so it is a return value and not state. The
 * proportional arm never enters the integrator: a single accumulator fed `(alpha + beta) * error`
 * is a different, first-order loop. The wrap is unconditional, once, in constant time.
 *
 * The error has one requirement. It is only that `E[error]` be, to first order about the lock
 * point, `detectorGain` times the quantity `phase` tracks, in the same units as `phase`, and
 * positive when `phase` must increase. A detector whose S-curve slopes the other way is negated
 * by its own block: negative gains put the poles outside the unit circle and the loop diverges
 * rather than mis-tracks.
 *
 * `detectorGain` is the S-curve slope at zero error. It is a property of the detector, the
 * modulation, the pulse shape, the input amplitude and the SNR, never of the loop, which cannot
 * measure it. It divides both gains, so a caller who passes `1` without knowing gets a loop whose
 * bandwidth is wrong by exactly that factor and no diagnostic. It is therefore a mandatory argument
 * with no default.
 *
 * The parameter is a noise bandwidth. `noiseBandwidth` is `Bn*T`, the one-sided equivalent noise
 * bandwidth of the closed loop normalized to the step rate; output noise power against white phase
 * noise is `2 * Bn*T * N0/2`. Take the loop filter to be proportional-plus-integral, match the
 * closed-loop denominator to the standard second-order prototype, and convert natural frequency to
 * bandwidth through `Bn = (wn/2) * (zeta + 1/(4*zeta))`:
 *
 * ```
 * theta = (Bn*T) / (zeta + 1/(4*zeta))          [ = wn*T / 2 ]
 * denom = 1 + 2*zeta*theta + theta*theta
 * alpha = (4 * zeta * theta) / denom / Kdet
 * beta  = (4 * theta * theta) / denom / Kdet
 * ```
 *
 * With `a = Kdet*alpha` and `b = Kdet*beta` the closed loop is
 * `H(z) = ((a + b)*z - a) / (z^2 + (a + b - 2)*z + (1 - a))`, and `H(1) = b/b = 1` identically for
 * any positive pair: constant phase and constant frequency are both tracked with zero error,
 * because the integrator supplies them. It is the cheapest check that the arms are not swapped.
 *
 * The noise-bandwidth relation is a continuous-time result carried into discrete time, so it is
 * asymptotically exact and not exact. Integrating `|H|^2` over the band, the delivered `Bn*T`
 * against the requested one:
 *
 * ```
 *   requested   zeta=0.5    zeta=0.7071   zeta=1      zeta=2
 *     0.001     0.0010010   0.0010009    0.0010006   0.0010002
 *     0.010     0.0101005   0.0100892    0.0100641   0.0100222
 *     0.100     0.1105000   0.1091852    0.1065280   0.1022275
 * ```
 *
 * Under 0.1% at `Bn*T <= 0.001`, under 1% at `Bn*T <= 0.01`, and 10.5% at `Bn*T = 0.1` at the
 * lightest damping, a bandwidth at which a second-order loop is of little use anyway. The limit is
 * accuracy and not stability: the poles stay inside the unit circle for every positive `Bn*T` the
 * formula is given, and at `Bn*T = 2, zeta = sqrt(2)/2` they sit at radius 0.511. Their
 * common modulus is `sqrt(1 - a)` wherever they are complex or equal.
 *
 * First order is a mode rather than setting `alpha` to zero afterwards. A frequency detector
 * measures the tracked quantity directly and has nothing for a proportional path to correct; the
 * recursion collapses to `frequency += lambda * (target - frequency)` with `lambda = beta * Kdet`,
 * whose closed-loop noise bandwidth is exactly `Bn*T = lambda / (2 * (2 - lambda))`, hence
 *
 * ```
 * lambda = 4*Bn*T / (1 + 2*Bn*T)      beta = lambda / Kdet
 * ```
 *
 * That inversion is a closed form and is exact. The `lambda = 4*Bn*T` approximation delivers
 * 0.01020 for a requested 0.010 and 0.12500 for a requested 0.100, 2% high and 25% high. Holding
 * the order inside the kernel keeps a later bandwidth change from re-deriving a proportional arm
 * the loop was never designed to have.
 *
 * The phase wrap is `std::remainder`: result in `[-pi, pi]`, exact, constant time, branch free,
 * correct for every finite input, and NaN-propagating rather than NaN-trapping. Repeated
 * subtraction of `2*pi` in a loop is none of those. It stops making progress once the subtrahend
 * falls below the argument's ULP: in `float` the smallest value for which `x - 2*pi == x` is
 * `1.342177440e+08`, the first representable value above `2^27`, and the largest that still
 * advances is `2^27` itself, so any phase at or above that is an infinite loop inside a per-sample
 * path, reachable from an unvalidated stream-tag payload. Below it, it terminates and is wrong:
 *
 * ```
 *   phase      iterations   subtractive   exact wrap    discrepancy mod 2*pi
 *        7             1     +0.7168145   +0.7168147     1.8e-07 rad
 *      100            15     +5.7522111   -0.5309649     9.3e-06 rad
 *    10000          1591     +3.4257035   -2.8310090     2.6e-02 rad
 *  1000000        158827     +2.7226090   -0.3575642     3.08 rad
 * ```
 *
 * The last row takes 158827 iterations to arrive at a number unrelated to its input. Reducing to
 * `+/-pi` rather than `+/-2*pi` also makes the state canonical, so a consumer of a `phase` output
 * never has to reduce it again and a detector forming `arg(x) - phase` needs no correction step.
 *
 * One caveat belongs to the `float` instantiation and not to the method: the reduction is exact for
 * the modulus it is given, and `2*pi` in `float` is 2.8e-8 away from `2*pi`. On a phase the loop
 * keeps bounded that costs `pi * 2.8e-8`, which is 1e-7 rad and negligible. On a phase allowed to
 * reach `1e7` it costs 0.28 rad, still an eighth of what repeated subtraction loses at the same
 * argument, and one more reason the reduction happens every step rather than once at the end.
 * A large argument arriving from outside is worth reducing in `double` before it is handed over.
 *
 * A timing loop wraps modulo its own estimated, varying period instead of modulo a constant; that
 * is `PhaseWrap::Period`, and it is `std::remainder(phase, frequency)` for exactly the same
 * reasons. Under repeated subtraction a non-positive period loops forever and has to be defended
 * against by clamping; under `remainder` a negative period is a sign flip and a zero period is a
 * NaN. Which mode applies is fixed at compile time so the step keeps no branch for it.
 *
 * The clamp is `min(max(frequency, minFrequency), maxFrequency)`, inside the step, and
 * `minFrequency <= maxFrequency` is a construction-time invariant that is checked. Written as an
 * `if`/`else if` pair with the bounds crossed it is not an error but a period-two limit cycle:
 * from `0` with `max = 0.1, min = 0.5` the state visits `0.5, 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, ...` once per sample,
 * indefinitely and with no diagnostic. Changing a bound re-clamps the state immediately rather than
 * waiting for the next update to pull it in, and setting the frequency clamps the assignment. A
 * loop parked against a bound is not tracking but reporting the closest frequency it may hold,
 * which `saturated()` answers for two comparisons on a value already in a register. There is no
 * clamp on the phase, which is an angle.
 *
 * The state is exactly two numbers, `frequency` and `phase`. Everything else, the gains, the bounds
 * and the order, is configuration. `reset` sets the two, wrapped and clamped, and those two numbers
 * are the whole of what a step reads and writes. Changing `noiseBandwidth`, `damping` or
 * `detectorGain` re-derives the gains and leaves the state where it was, so a receiver that widens
 * its loop to reacquire and narrows it again keeps the frequency it found.
 *
 * Hot path, no exemption: every block holding one of these steps it once per input sample, and the
 * family includes blocks sitting directly on a device stream. A step is one multiply-add, two
 * comparisons, one multiply-add, one add and one reduction, and the reduction is the only part with
 * a cost worth discussing. `std::remainder` is what the phase rule means, and it is correctly
 * rounded and exception-aware, so it compiles to a call. The step computes the same number as
 * `phase - 2*pi * nearbyint(phase / (2*pi))`, which is branch free and agrees bit for bit over the
 * argument a step can form. Over `float` at `-O3` a second-order step then costs 0.62x what it does
 * with `std::remainder`, the reduction itself falling to 0.44x.
 *
 * The substitution is legal because the argument a step can form is bounded twice over.
 * `_phase` is whatever the previous reduction returned, so `|_phase| <= pi`; the increment is
 * `frequency + alpha*error` with the frequency clamped on the line above, so it is bounded by
 * `max(|minFrequency|, |maxFrequency|) + |alpha*error|`. The two forms are bit-for-bit identical for
 * `|argument| < 3*pi`, so the requirement on a block's own clamp is
 *
 * ```
 * max(|minFrequency|, |maxFrequency|) + |alpha*error| < 2*pi
 * ```
 *
 * which a carrier loop meets with room to spare: its frequency is radians per sample and cannot
 * exceed `+/-pi` without aliasing, its error is an angle no larger than `pi`, and `alpha` at the
 * widest useful bandwidth (`Bn*T = 0.1`) is 0.233, an increment under 3.88 rad against the 6.28 the
 * bound allows, and a wrap argument under 7.02 against `3*pi = 9.42`. At exactly `3*pi` the two
 * forms part company by a whole turn rather than by a rounding error, which is why the bound is a
 * requirement and not a tolerance. The only inputs inside the envelope where they differ are
 * `-0` and `-2*pi`, where the cheap form returns `+0` and `remainder` returns `-0`: the same angle,
 * and the same value under every comparison.
 *
 * `setPhase` and `reset` keep `std::remainder`. Their argument comes from outside the loop, from a
 * stream tag or a caller's estimate, and nothing bounds it. The cheap form is used where the bound
 * is a property of the code rather than an assumption about the caller.
 *
 * Skipping the wrap where the caller's own `sincos` would reduce the argument anyway does not work:
 * at one radian per sample an unwrapped `float` phase reaches `2^24` after 16.8 million samples,
 * seventeen seconds at 1 MS/s, and from there stops advancing. `PhaseWrap::None` exists so
 * the wrap's share stays a measured number, not so that it can be turned off.
 *
 * The state type is a template parameter defaulting to `float`, which matches the sample type and
 * keeps the step in one register file. `double` exists for the callers that need the integrator's
 * zero steady-state error to be exact rather than to be a dead band: at `beta = 3.5e-4` a `float`
 * integrator stops moving once the residual falls below `ulp(frequency) / (2*beta)`.
 *
 * @see Rice, Michael, Digital Communications: A Discrete-Time Approach — the discrete-time
 *      phase-locked loop gain design above: the proportional-plus-integral loop filter, the match
 *      to the second-order prototype, and the conversion from natural frequency to equivalent noise
 *      bandwidth through `Bn = (wn/2)(zeta + 1/(4*zeta))`.
