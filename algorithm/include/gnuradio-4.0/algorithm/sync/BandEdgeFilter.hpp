/**
 * @brief The band-edge filter pair and its power discriminant: a carrier-frequency error estimate
 * that needs no carrier, no data decisions and no symbol timing.
 *
 * A signal shaped by a root-raised-cosine of excess bandwidth `alpha` and symbol period `T` is flat
 * out to `(1-alpha)/(2T)`, falls to zero at `(1+alpha)/(2T)`, and is symmetric about zero. An
 * offset in frequency breaks that symmetry by an amount monotone in the offset over roughly the
 * transition band. Two matched filters sitting on the two edges measure the break. The taps follow
 * from the derivation:
 *
 * 1. The discriminant is the matched filter's derivative in frequency. What changes when the signal
 *    shifts is the energy at the edges, so the sensitivity is `dH/df`: zero wherever the response
 *    is flat, nonzero only across the transition.
 * 2. Across the transition the amplitude is a quarter cosine, `cos((pi*T/(2*alpha))*(|f| -
 *    (1-alpha)/(2T)))`, falling from 1 to 0. Its derivative is a quarter sine, zero at the inner
 *    edge and largest at the outer edge `(1+alpha)/(2T)`.
 * 3. Mirror that quarter sine about the outer edge and it is a half cycle: a half cosine centered on
 *    the band edge, of total width `2*alpha/T`.
 * 4. Invert it. A half cosine `cos(pi*(f-f0)/W)` over `|f-f0| <= W/2` transforms to
 *    `(W/2)*[sinc(W*t - 1/2) + sinc(W*t + 1/2)]*exp(j*2*pi*f0*t)`, with `sinc(u) = sin(pi u)/(pi u)`.
 *    The bracket is a real, symmetric, low-pass prototype; the exponential puts it on the edge.
 *
 * With `t` in samples, `W = 2*alpha/sps` cycles per sample and `f0 = (1+alpha)/(2*sps)`:
 *
 * ```
 * n        = i - (N-1)/2                                   i = 0 .. N-1
 * b[n]     = sinc(2*alpha*n/sps - 1/2) + sinc(2*alpha*n/sps + 1/2)
 * b        = b / sum(b^2)                                  see normalization below
 * upper[n] = b[n] * exp(+j*2*pi*f0*n)
 * lower[n] = conj(upper[n])
 * ```
 *
 * The `-3 dB` width of a half cosine of total width `W` is `W/2`, so the filters peak at
 * `(1+alpha)/(2*sps)` and are `alpha/sps` wide, the width converging on `alpha/sps` from above as
 * `N` grows.
 *
 * The grid is centered, for any `N` and any `sps`. Both the prototype and the spin are evaluated on
 * `n = i - (N-1)/2` in floating point, so `N` need not be odd and `sps` need not divide anything.
 * Building the prototype on a grid whose center is `rint(N/sps)` and spinning it on one centered at
 * the integer `(N-1)/2` gives the same result only when `N` is odd and `(N-1)/sps` is an integer;
 * elsewhere the prototype loses its symmetry, by up to 60% of the peak tap at tap counts an ordinary
 * caller would choose. That does not bias the discriminant, since the two tap vectors are elementwise
 * conjugates and `|H_upper(f)| = |H_lower(-f)|` whatever the prototype's symmetry, but it costs the
 * phase linearity a band-edge discriminant rests on, and with it error variance.
 *
 * Normalization: the prototype is divided by the sum of its squared taps, by its energy rather than
 * by its root energy, which makes the detector gain independent of `alpha` and of the tap count and
 * equal to a value a caller can write down,
 *
 * ```
 * Kdet = sps * P            error units per cycle/sample of offset
 *      = sps * P / (2*pi)   error units per rad/sample, the units the loop gains are designed in
 * ```
 *
 * to within 1.2% over `sps` from 2 to 8, `alpha` from 0.22 to 0.5 and `N` from 33 to 89, with `P`
 * the mean input power. `Kdet` is proportional to that power, so a block built on this requires an
 * AGC in front of it. `normalizedDiscriminant` serves a caller who cannot promise one: bounded in
 * `[-1, 1]` and independent of the input power, at the cost of a gain that depends on `sps`, `alpha`
 * and `N` together and has to be measured per design.
 *
 * The sign. The error is `|yu|^2 - |yl|^2`: a signal that has drifted up puts more energy in the
 * upper filter, so the error is positive and `Kdet` is positive, as the loop kernel requires of
 * every detector in this family. A block closing the loop on it therefore derotates by
 * `exp(-j*phase)`.
 *
 * The S-curve in that sign is odd, close to linear inside about a third of the pull-in range, and
 * flat beyond `(1+alpha)/(2*sps)`, which is where a frequency clamp belongs;
 * `bandEdgeFrequencyLimit` returns it in rad/sample. A wider clamp lets a loop wander into the flat
 * part of its own S-curve and sit there.
 *
 * Cost. The direct form is two complex-tap FIRs over a complex stream, `2*4*N` real multiplies per
 * sample, which dominates everything else a frequency-locked loop does. Because
 * `upper[n] = b[n]*exp(+j*2*pi*f0*n)` with `b` real,
 *
 * ```
 * |sum_n upper[n] * y[m-n]|  ==  |sum_n b[n] * y'[m-n]|      with  y'[k] = y[k]*exp(-j*2*pi*f0*k)
 * ```
 *
 * The residual `exp(-j*2*pi*f0*m)` is common to the whole sum and only the magnitude is wanted, so
 * rotating the stream up and down by `f0` and filtering each with the real prototype gives the same
 * output for about a third less work. The two conjugate rotations share their four products, and a
 * recursive rotator is admissible here, unlike in a carrier loop, because `f0` is a constant.
 * `BandEdgeForm::ComplexTaps` is the reference the QA holds `RealTaps` against; `RealTaps` is the
 * default. Even so this is the most expensive stage in a synchronization chain, so a receiver able to
 * confine a frequency-locked loop to acquisition should do so.
 *
 * The rotator carries its phase in `double` and is renormalized by one Newton step every 256 samples.
 * A `float` rotator would also hold the identity above, its differential phase error across the
 * window random-walking to a few parts in `1e7` over `1e5` samples, but `double` costs four
 * multiplies against `4*N` `float` ones, so the drift is bought out cheaply.
 *
 * Each history is a doubled ring, every sample written twice, at `w` and `w+N`, so the window handed
 * to a dot product is always a contiguous run of exactly `N` in the same order. That fixes the
 * accumulation order at `N` alone, whatever a call carries, so the output is bit-identical under any
 * chunking. Redesign on a parameter change is `O(N)` and belongs in the settings path.
 *
 * @see harris, f. j., Multirate Signal Processing for Communication Systems, on the band-edge
 *      frequency-locked loop: the band-edge filters as the derivative of the matched filter's
 *      frequency response, the half-wave approximation to that derivative, and the power-difference
 *      discriminant. The step-by-step inversion above is this header's own working of it.
