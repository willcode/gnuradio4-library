/**
 * @brief The timing error detectors as pure kernels.
 *
 * The sign convention; the wrong sign here makes the loop diverge:
 *
 * ```
 * tau_e  is the timing error of the sampling instant, in symbol periods,
 *        positive when the estimate is early (the true instant is later).
 * ```
 *
 * With that sign every S-curve here slopes upward through zero, every `Kted` is positive, and a
 * loop whose integral update is `averagePeriod += beta * error` lengthens the period and pushes the
 * next instant later, which is the correction an early estimate needs. A detector implemented with
 * the opposite sign is negated in its own definition, never by negating the loop gains.
 *
 * `y[k]` is the interpolated sample at symbol instant `k`, `y[k-1/2]` the sample half a symbol
 * earlier, `y'[k]` the derivative at the instant, and `a[k]` the decision for `y[k]`. Real and
 * imaginary contributions are added, which for a real input is just the real term. The caller
 * supplies the decisions: these kernels take `a[k]` as an argument and are independent of the constellation.
 *
 * ```
 *   detector          in/sym  decisions  derivative  error
 *   Mueller & Muller     1       yes         no      Re{a[k-1]}Re{y[k]} - Re{a[k]}Re{y[k-1]}, + Im
 *   modified M&M         1       yes         no      Re{(y[k]-y[k-2])conj(a[k-1]) - (a[k]-a[k-2])conj(y[k-1])}
 *   zero crossing        2       yes         no      (Re{a[k-1]} - Re{a[k]})Re{y[k-1/2]}, + Im
 *   Gardner              2       no          no      (Re{y[k-1]} - Re{y[k]})Re{y[k-1/2]}, + Im
 *   early-late           2       no          no      (Re{y[k+1/2]} - Re{y[k-1/2]})Re{y[k]}, + Im

 *   signum x slope ML    1       no          yes     (sgn(Re{y})Re{y'} + sgn(Im{y})Im{y'}) / 2
 * ```
 *
 * The modified M&M and the two maximum-likelihood forms clip symmetrically at `+/-1`; the others do
 * not. Two properties decide most choices:
 *
 * - Gardner and early-late are blind. No decisions, so no dependence on the carrier phase: both are
 *   `Re{(u - v) conj(w)}` with `u`, `v` and `w` drawn from the same stream, and a common rotation of
 *   all three leaves the real part unchanged. They work before the carrier loop has locked.
 * - M&M and zero crossing need decisions, hence a locked carrier and a known constellation.
 *
 * `Kted`, the detector gain, is the slope of `E[e]` against `tau_e` at zero, in error units per
 * symbol period on an ideal Nyquist channel at unit average symbol power. Every form but one is
 * proportional to that power, so an AGC in front is mandatory, as it is for the band-edge
 * discriminant; the signum form scales with the constellation's mean axis magnitude instead. Each
 * detector has a gain function below, evaluated on the raised-cosine pulse a matched pair of
 * root-raised-cosine filters leaves. Only Gardner and early-late need the pulse summed; the rest
 * reduce to a closed form or to a single derivative of the pulse.
 *
 * A loop needs `Kted` per input sample, not per symbol, because a timing kernel's period state is in
 * input samples. `detectorGainPerSample` is the conversion and is the one place it should happen;
 * getting it wrong scales the loop bandwidth by `sps`.
 *
 * M&M, zero crossing, Gardner and early-late have odd S-curves that cross zero only at `tau_e = 0`
 * within `+/-0.5` and return to zero at the half-symbol boundary, an unstable false lock point.
 * Gardner and early-late share an S-curve; what separates them is the self-noise about it, which is
 * pure data-pattern jitter on an ideal channel. M&M and modified M&M have none of it there, since
 * `y[k] = a[k]` at `tau_e = 0` and the expression cancels identically, so M&M is the detector of
 * choice wherever decisions exist.
 * Early-late carries roughly three times Gardner's self-noise for the same S-curve and needs a sample
 * after the symbol instant, which costs an extra interpolation.
 *
 * Every kernel is a handful of multiplies with no branch except the clip and the signum, is
 * `constexpr`, and takes its arguments by value; all seven cost a rounding error against the
 * interpolation that feeds them. Which detector to run is a question about noise, not about cost.
