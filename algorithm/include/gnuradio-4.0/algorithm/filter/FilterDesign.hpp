/**
 * @brief Windowed-sinc FIR design, and measurement of what a design delivers.
 *
 * Design and verification are separate. `kaiserLowpass` computes a tap set for a length, a cutoff
 * and an attenuation. `scanLowpass` reads the response of a tap set and reports what it delivers,
 * and `searchLowpass` uses that to find the shortest length that meets a target.
 *
 * The search costs a response scan per candidate; a caller with a deadline uses
 * `kaiserLength`'s estimate instead.
 *
 * Design is setup path. Nothing here runs per sample: taps are computed when a setting changes.
 * The cost is O(N) transcendental calls for a design and O(N * grid) for a scan. The hot path is
 * whatever consumes the taps, where every extra tap is a multiply-accumulate per output sample.
 * All internal evaluation is `double`; the returned taps are `float`, rounded once.
