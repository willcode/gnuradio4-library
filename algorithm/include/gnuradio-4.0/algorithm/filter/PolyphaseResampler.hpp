/**
 * @brief An exact `L/M` rate change: `L` outputs for every `M` inputs.
 *
 * The naive construction inserts `L-1` zeros between input samples, filters at the resulting rate
 * and keeps every `M`th sample. The polyphase form below computes exactly that result without
 * materializing the zeros or the intermediate stream. Only the taps at indices congruent to `k*M`
 * modulo `L` meet a non-zero sample, so an output costs one dot product of `N/L` taps instead of
 * `N`. At `L = 147, M = 160` over 5880 taps that is 36.75 multiply-accumulates per input sample
 * against the naive 864360, a factor of `L*M`.
 *
 * With `h` the prototype padded to a multiple of `L` and `B = N/L` the branch length, output `k`
 * counted from the start of the stream is
 *
 * ```
 * p_k  = (k * M) mod L            the branch
 * i_k  = floor(k * M / L)         the input anchor
 * y[k] = sum_{r=0..B-1} h[p_k + r*L] * x[i_k - r]
 * ```
 *
 * which the implementation walks as an integer phase accumulator: emit at branch `ctr`, add `M`,
 * and advance the input while `ctr >= L`. The two forms agree exactly. The accumulator carries
 * across calls, so `ctr` and the input history are the whole of the state, the counter being an
 * integer and the history a plain shift register.
 *
 * The history starts at zero, for the reason `HalfbandCascade::primeWithSilence` exists: a block
 * with a fixed input-to-output ratio has to deliver that ratio from its first sample. The first `B`
 * outputs are the filter's rise out of a zeroed window, which is what a filter starting on silence
 * does. The alternative, waiting for a full window, offsets the whole stream by the group delay and
 * breaks the tag map.
 *
 * Chunk independence is a correctness property. The values summed for output `k` are fixed by `k`
 * alone, but their order is not automatic: floating-point addition is not associative, so an
 * implementation that takes four outputs at a time when four are available and one otherwise
 * returns different last bits for the same input under different chunking. The dot product here
 * accumulates into a fixed number of lanes with a fixed tail and a fixed lane reduction, all three
 * determined by the branch length alone, whatever a call's length or span boundaries are.
 *
 * This is hot path code. The inner loop is one contiguous-tap dot product over a contiguous input
 * run, which vectorizes with no gather; the branch table is stored branch-major, each branch
 * reversed, so selecting a branch is a pointer add and the samples are read forward. Allocation,
 * locking and dispatch all happen at construction.
 *
 * Each output is a plain dot product. `HalfbandCascade`'s shape, sixteen outputs at a time so that a
 * tap becomes a scalar broadcast, suits a cascade whose consecutive outputs share a branch; here
 * they use different branches. Measured over `std::complex<float>` on one core with 65536 input
 * samples, relative to the cheapest row:
 *
 * ```
 *   L/M       taps/branch   multiplies per input sample   cost
 *   1/2            77                  38.5               1.16
 *   3/2            37                  55.5               1.94
 *   1/25          907                  36.3               1.00
 *   147/160        40                  36.8               1.22
 * ```
 *
 * The cost tracks the multiplies per input sample (`N/M`) rather than the branch length: 907 taps a
 * branch at `1/25` is the cheapest row here. Time per complex multiply-accumulate is flat to within
 * 1.3x across the four at the tree's baseline `x86-64`, and a further 1.25x to 1.4x is available
 * where the wider ISA is allowed.
 *
 * The tap type costs `4 : 2 : 2 : 1` in real multiplies (complex taps on complex samples, either
 * mixed pair, two reals) and delivers it: measured per tap and output at the baseline ISA, the
 * first costs about 4.5x the last and the mixed pairs about 2.4x. A real-valued tap set carried in
 * a complex container therefore costs exactly double for the same arithmetic, and a downconverter
 * that rotates first and filters with a real prototype is the cheaper of the two routes to a
 * translating filter.
 *
 * Two cases belong elsewhere. `L = M = 1` after reduction is a pass-through, which `designResampler`
 * answers with a single unit tap rather than a filter. `L = 1` with `M` a power of two is handled by
 * `HalfbandCascade` several times faster, and the caller selects that route explicitly.
 *
 * @see harris, f. j., Multirate Signal Processing for Communication Systems: the polyphase
 *      decomposition of an interpolate-by-L / decimate-by-M chain and the commutator formulation
 *      the phase accumulator implements.

/**
 * @brief Design a stated ladder: every stage is given the same passband in hertz.
 *
 * A stage whose output rate is `Ro` need only reject above `Ro - W/2`, that being the lowest
 * frequency its own decimation folds inside the `+/-W/2` the caller asked to keep. At the top of
 * the ladder, where a tap is paid at the device's rate, `W` is a rounding error against the rate:
 * the transition band is nearly half the rate wide and thirteen taps deliver 85 dB. The length
 * migrates to the last stage, which runs at a small fraction of the rate and is where a long
 * filter is nearly free.
 *
 * With `fs = 1`, `W = passbandWidth / decimation` is the width the output keeps, expressed at the
 * input. Stage `i` has input rate `r_i = 1 / p_{i-1}` and edges, in cycles per sample of its own
 * input,
 *
 * ```
 * passEdge_i = (W/2) / r_i
 * stopEdge_i = (r_i/d_i - W/2) / r_i
 * ```
 *
 * A halving stage's two edges then stand symmetrically about `0.25`, which is the definition of a
 * halfband and the reason its even-offset taps vanish. Its design cutoff is set to exactly `0.25`
 * rather than to the midpoint the search computed, so the zeros are exact to the bits the window is
 * evaluated in, 322 to 332 dB under the peak, `sin` of a rounded multiple of pi, and the kernel may
 * skip them by index rather than by testing.
 *
 * Each stage's length is searched against its realized response, for @p attenuationDb and for
 * @p rippleDb divided evenly among the stages. The window is Kaiser because a windowed design's
 * floor is the window's: a Blackman-Harris sidelobe does not go below about 92 dB however many taps
 * are spent on it, and a Kaiser's beta follows the attenuation asked for.
 *
 * `D = 64`, `passbandWidth = 0.90`, the ladder in full:
 *
 * ```
 *   stage  decim   input rate   passEdge   stopEdge     N   live   MAC/input   stopband

 * ```
 *
 * 8.64 MAC per input sample against a single 3431-tap decimator's 53.61, ripple sum 0.0023 dB,
 * group delay 2158 input samples. The last stage is nine times the length of the first and costs a
 * quarter of it.
 *
 * The gain is not uniform. The single-stage cost barely moves with `D`, 53.6 to 53.9 MAC/input
 * across a 64-fold range, its length growing in proportion to `D` while the cost is `N/D`, so all
 * of staging's gain is the staged figure falling, and it falls with the number of halvings, not
 * with `D`. At `D = 25` with one polyphase stage the ladder degenerates to the single filter it is
 * being compared with and reclaims nothing.
 *
 * Measured, MAC per input sample, at 85 dB and 0.05 dB of total ripple:

 *
 * Factoring the odd part is worth 3x at the shape the simple rule gives up on: `D = 25` as one
 * stage of 25 is 53.88 MAC/input and as two stages of 5 is 17.84. It cannot help with an odd prime
 * `D`, which is one stage either way and 1.00x. `passbandWidth` matters as much as `D`: a passband
 * filling 90 % of the output rate leaves a transition of `(1 - width)/D` and gains 3.3x to 7.4x,
 * where at 80 % the single stage is half as long to begin with and the gains are 2.2x to 3.7x.
 *
 * `worstStopbandDb` is the least attenuated stage, which is what the acceptance rule asks for: a
 * frequency reaches the output band only if every stage passes it and folds into `+/-W/2` only from
 * above some stage's own stop edge, so a fold path crosses one stopband and several passbands, and
 * what bounds it is the worst any single stage delivers over its own fold region. Measured across
 * the sweep at `passbandWidth = 0.90` it is -85.39 dB for every ladder ending in a halving stage,
 * the last stage being the one designed closest to its target, and -85.09 dB for `D = 25` as a
 * single stage of 25. Every ripple sum comes out around twenty times inside the 0.05 dB budget: the
 * budget is divided as a worst case on the assumption that stage ripples add, and measured they
 * largely do not.
 *
 * This is setup path and costs one length search per stage, each a response scan per candidate, so
 * the result is memoized by the whole parameter tuple: a retune returning to a ladder already built
 * pays nothing.
 *
 * @param ladder        the stage decimations, from `stagedDecimatorLadder` or stated; `{D}` is the
 *                      single-stage design the ladder is judged against
 * @param decimation    the product the ladder performs, which fixes `W` and therefore every edge
 * @param passbandWidth the fraction of the output rate the passband occupies, in `(0, 1)`; not of
 *                      the input rate, and not a frequency: every edge in the law is a ratio, and a
 *                      caller thinking in hertz divides once at the call site where the rate is known
