/**
 * @brief A rate change by a real factor, realized as a stated rational that never drifts.
 *
 * `PolyphaseResampler` covers only an exact `L/M`, and the tap count of an exact
 * rational design grows like `max(l, m)` after reduction: 48 kHz to 44.1 kHz is `147/160` and
 * costs 5880 taps. Two free-running device clocks stand in an effectively irrational ratio. This
 * block bounds the filter instead: the prototype is designed once for a bank of `L` arms and its
 * length per arm follows the attenuation, the rolloff and the direction of the rate change alone.
 * Measured at `rolloff = 0.2` and 60 dB, taps per arm is 37 at every
 * bank size from 8 to 128; doubling `L` doubles the prototype and halves the share each arm gets.
 *
 * The cost is exactly `q+1` times the arithmetic of an exact rational resampler, `q` being the
 * interpolation order, in exchange for a tap count set by the attenuation and the rolloff alone
 * and a ratio free to be irrational. Use `RationalResampler` for a ratio that is a small fraction:
 * `1/5` and `6` and `19/24` are exactly rational, cost half the arithmetic there and are exact.
 *
 * The prototype's cutoff scales with the rate below one. Arm `p` produces the signal at input time offset `p/L`, so a
 * prototype cut at the interpolated Nyquist over `L` leaves the bank passing the input band
 * through; stepping the anchor by more than one input sample then folds everything above the
 * output Nyquist straight in. Measured at `L = 32`, `r = 0.2`, a tone at 0.25 cycles per input
 * sample:
 *
 * ```
 *   prototype                          length   the tone, at the output
 *   scaled   (stopEdge = 0.5*r/L)       5787         -82.93 dB
 *   unscaled (stopEdge = 0.5/L)         1159           0.00 dB
 * ```
 *
 * The unscaled prototype passes the alias at full amplitude, 83 dB above the scaled one.
 *
 * One bank serves every order. It is `L + 2` arms of `B + 1` taps, `L + 4` at order 3, with
 * `arm[p][r] = h[p + (r-1)*L]` and every arm reading the same window. The `r = 0` term is zero for
 * every arm below `L` and the first real tap for the wrap arms, which is what makes the branch-free
 * arm wrap fall out of one formula. Written instead as a second filterbank of difference taps, the
 * interpolation doubles the tap memory and fixes the order at one.
 *
 * The phase advances in fixed point throughout. The step through the interpolated grid is
 * `round(L/r * 2^32)`, so the realized ratio is exactly `L * 2^32 / step`, a rational the kernel
 * reports and holds at any stream length and on any schedule, within `2^-33 * r / L` of the
 * request. Measured at `L = 32`: `2.7e-12` relative at `19/24`, or 0.011 samples a day at 48 kHz.
 * Deriving the same step from a `float` rate costs `4.0e-08` and 165 samples a day at that rate, so
 * it is the rate's own precision, rather than the accumulator's, that sets the drift: a `float`
 * accumulator contributes `3e-2` interpolated samples per million outputs, a fortieth of it.
 *
 * This is the hot path. `(q+1)` dot products of `B+1` taps per output, `(q+1)*(B+1)*r` per input
 * sample, flat at `(q+1)*(B+1)` below unity because `B` scales as `1/r`: 76 multiply-accumulates
 * per input sample at the defaults against `RationalResampler`'s 36.75 at the same design targets.
 * The reduction tree is `PolyphaseResampler`'s, eight independent accumulator chains fixed by `B`
 * alone and worth fourteen times against one running sum, and adjacent arms are adjacent in memory,
 * so the `q+1` arms an output needs are one contiguous run.
 *
 * @see harris, f. j., Multirate Signal Processing for Communication Systems, chapter 7.5 — the
 *      polyphase filterbank read as an interpolator with a fractional-delay commutator.

     *
     * The arm count follows the node set: `{0,1}` at orders 0 and 1 reaches `p = L`, and
     * `{-1,0,1,2}` at order 3 reaches `p = L+1` from `p = -1`. Order 0 needs the second arm because
