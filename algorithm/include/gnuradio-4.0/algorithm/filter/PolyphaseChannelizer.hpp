/**
 * @brief Designs a channelizer prototype and measures what it delivers, rather than trusting a length estimate.
 *
 * The length is searched, not predicted: the shortest prototype whose measured stopband and passband ripple meet the
 * request is the one returned, which is the discipline the resampler designs beside this one already follow. What was
 * achieved comes back with the taps, so a caller can see whether the request was met rather than assume it.
 *
 * Three families, and the choice between them is a real trade at critical sampling. `root_nyquist` is a root-raised
 * cosine whose squared responses sum flat across the bank, which is the condition an analysis and a synthesis bank
 * meet to cancel; its rejection is set by how many channel spacings it covers, so that is what the search grows.
 * `lowpass` is a Kaiser at half a channel spacing and rejects far more for the same length, and does not reconstruct.
 * `boxcar` is one channel long, making the bank a plain block transform whose inverse is its own synthesis: it is the
 * only family that reconstructs critically sampled, and it isolates almost nothing, so its length is fixed and the
 * search does not apply.
 *
 * @param channels       M
 * @param family         `root_nyquist`, `lowpass` or `boxcar`
 * @param attenuationDb  the stopband the lowpass search has to reach; the other families are measured, not aimed
 * @param transition     excess bandwidth in channel spacings: a transition width to the lowpass, a rolloff to the
 *                       root-Nyquist
 * @param maxRippleDb    the passband ripple the search has to stay under
 * @param span           channel spacings the root-Nyquist prototype covers; the other families size themselves
 * @param oversample     the commutator stride the bank will run, which is what sets where aliasing starts
 * @param maxSpan        the cap the lowpass search may grow to

 * -60.1 dB at its designed 121 taps and -20.0 dB padded to 128, while the bank built from either measures the same

 * commutator's stride `S = M / oversample`:
 *
 *     y_k[n] = exp(-j*2*pi*k*n*S/M) * sum_r exp(+j*2*pi*k*r/M) * v_r[n]

 * belongs to branch zero and the branch index counts backwards through the step's samples, which is the index
 * convention everything else here is stated against.
 *
 * The leading phase is one at every step when the bank is critically sampled, because the commutator then advances a
 * whole `M`. Oversampled by two it alternates `(-1)^k`, and that alternation is the whole of what the oversampled
 * mode adds to the arithmetic.
 *
 * Channel `k` is centered at `k*fs/M`, with indices above `M/2` reading as the negative frequencies in the usual
 * transform order.
