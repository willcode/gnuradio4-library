/**
 * Reed-Solomon over GF(2^M), shortened, with the generator's roots at a stated power of a stated
 * primitive element upward.
 *
 * A code is fixed by its field — the symbol width M and the primitive polynomial — and by how
 * many parity symbols R it carries; the natural block length is 2^M - 1 symbols and the code
 * corrects R/2 symbol errors. The driving instantiations are P25 Phase 1's three codes over
 * GF(64) on x^6 + x + 1 (TIA-102.BAAA), reached through the `ReedSolomon6` alias:
 *
 *   RS(24,12,13)  R = 12, corrects 6   Link Control, in a voice frame carrying it
 *   RS(24,16,9)   R =  8, corrects 4   Encryption Sync, in a voice frame carrying it
 *   RS(36,20,17)  R = 16, corrects 8   the header that opens a transmission
 *
 * All three are the 63-symbol code SHORTENED: the transmitter and receiver both know that
 * the leading symbols are zero and neither sends them. A shortened code is decoded by
 * putting those zeros back, which is why every entry point here works on a full block and
 * takes the count of leading symbols the air did not carry.
 *
 * Shortening is also a free check, and it is taken. A decoder that places an error inside
 * the padding is saying the received word is not a word of the shortened code at all — the
 * implementations this behavior was compared against skip such a correction and return the
 * remaining symbols as though nothing had happened, which is the silent-wrong-answer case in
 * its purest form. Here the correction is applied and the padding is then checked, so the
 * word is reported invalid instead. The same reasoning covers the final syndrome check: after
 * correction the syndromes must all vanish, and if they do not, the decoder has found a
 * locator polynomial whose roots do not describe the received word and has no business
 * returning symbols.
 *
 * The decoder is Berlekamp-Massey for the error locator, a Chien search for its roots and
 * Forney's formula for the magnitudes, with the field's logarithm and antilogarithm tables
 * carrying every multiplication. Erasures are not supported: no consumer knows which symbols
 * are doubtful in the sense the erasure path needs, and the code that is not written cannot
 * be the code that is wrong.
 *
 * **Where the generator's roots start, and how far apart they are.** A Reed-Solomon code is fixed
 * by its field and by the `Roots` consecutive powers its generator vanishes at, and two families
 * disagree about which powers those are. The roots are `beta^f .. beta^(f+Roots-1)` with
 * `beta = alpha^PrimitiveStep` and `f = FirstConsecutiveRoot`; both default to 1, which is the
 * landed convention and leaves every existing instantiation bit-identical. CCSDS 131.0-B-5 4.3.4
 * writes its generator as the product over `j = 128-E .. 127+E` of `(x - alpha^(11j))`, so its two
 * numbers are read straight off the product limits: `PrimitiveStep = 11` and
 * `FirstConsecutiveRoot = 128 - E`, which is 112 at `E = 16` and 120 at `E = 8`.
 *
 * Four places carry the two parameters and every one of them reduces to the landed expression at
 * `f = 1, PrimitiveStep = 1`: the generator's roots, the syndrome evaluation points, the Chien
 * search's step, and Forney's magnitude, which gains the factor `X^(1-f)`. That factor is the one
 * that is easy to leave out, and leaving it out produces a decoder that locates errors correctly
 * and corrects them wrongly — caught here by the post-correction syndrome check, which then fails
 * on every correctable word rather than on none.

/**
 * @brief The dual (Berlekamp) basis of GF(2^M), as the two element-wise recodings between it and the
 * conventional basis.
 *
 * The conventional basis is `(1, alpha, ..., alpha^(M-1))`, so an element is
 * `u_(M-1) alpha^(M-1) + ... + u_1 alpha + u_0`. A second basis is `(1, b, b^2, ..., b^(M-1))` with
 * `b = alpha^BasisExponent`, and the **dual** basis `(l_0, ..., l_(M-1))` is defined by
 * `Tr(l_i b^j) = 1` when `i == j` and `0` otherwise, where the trace is
 * `Tr(z) = sum over k = 0..M-1 of z^(2^k)`. A symbol in the dual representation is
 * `z_0 l_0 + ... + z_(M-1) l_(M-1)`.
 *
 * Everything follows from those two sentences in one line. Taking the trace of `w b^j` where
 * `w = sum_i z_i l_i` gives `Tr(w b^j) = sum_i z_i Tr(l_i b^j) = z_j`, so
 *
 *     z_j = Tr(w * b^j) = sum over k of u_k * T[j][k],   T[j][k] = Tr(alpha^k * alpha^(BasisExponent*j))
 *
 * which is an M by M matrix over GF(2) computed from the field polynomial alone. The map is a
 * GF(2)-linear bijection, so a table of `2^M` entries realizes it and its inverse is the scatter of
 * that table — built here with a written-count check, on the pattern `Golay.hpp` uses for its coset
 * table, so a `BasisExponent` whose first M powers are not independent is a build failure and not a
 * quietly wrong table.
 *
 * **Octet packing.** CCSDS 131.0-B-5 1.6.3 numbers the first transmitted bit of a field as the most
 * significant, and 4.3.9.2 transmits `z_0` first, so `z_j` occupies bit `M-1-j` of the dual octet
 * while `u_k` occupies bit `k` of the conventional one in the ordinary way. Both packings are stated
 * because they are the only remaining place a correct transformation still produces a wrong byte.
 *
 * `T` is GF(2)-linear but is **not** a field isomorphism — it does not preserve multiplication — so
 * every arithmetic step stays in the conventional representation and the recoding is applied to a
 * whole block before and after a call, never inside the decoder's loops.

/**
 * @brief The symbol interleaving of CCSDS 131.0-B-5 4.4.1, as the index map it is.
 *
 * A commutator distributes successive codeblock symbols across `depth` encoders and a second
 * commutator reassembles them in step, which stated as an index map is: codeblock symbol `s` belongs
 * to codeword `s mod depth` at position `s div depth` within it. At `depth = 1` the map is the
 * identity and the codeblock is one codeword, which is the standard's own statement that `I = 1` is
 * the absence of interleaving.
 *
 * Shortening composes with it exactly as the standard states: the fill `Q` is a multiple of `depth`
 * (4.3.7.3), so every codeword carries the same `pad = Q / depth` leading zeros and a shortened
 * transmitted codeblock is `(kBlock - pad) * depth` symbols. That makes this the `block` permutation
 * of `spec-interleavers.md` at `rows = kBlock - pad` and `cols = depth`, which is what the qa proves
 * rather than what this comment asserts.
 *
 * The code itself stays a one-codeword entity: these are free functions over a whole codeblock, not
 * members, because interleaving is a property of how codewords are laid out on the wire and not of
 * the code.
