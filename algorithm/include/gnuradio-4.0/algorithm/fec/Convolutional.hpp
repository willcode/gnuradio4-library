/**
 * Non-recursive, non-systematic convolutional codes of rate 1/n, with a terminated
 * maximum-likelihood Viterbi decoder.
 *
 * A code is a constraint length K, three through nine, and n generator polynomials, two through
 * four of them, each K bits wide and conventionally spelled in octal. Polynomial bit i, counting
 * from the least significant, taps the input delayed by i steps: bit 0 is the current input bit
 * and bit K-1 the oldest the shift register holds. One input step emits one bit per polynomial,
 * in the order the polynomials are given.
 *
 * That convention has an anchor which needs no implementation to check against. Drive the encoder
 * with a single one followed by zeros and step i emits bit i of each polynomial, so the impulse
 * response read least significant bit first is the polynomials themselves. This is what a
 * generator polynomial means, and it is the property against which a code's spelling can be
 * checked against any published statement of a standard code.
 *
 * Frames are terminated. The encoder appends K-1 zero bits after the information, so k
 * information bits become (k + K - 1) * n coded bits and the trellis both starts and ends in the
 * zero state. One record is one such frame, which is what makes the decode exact: the decoder
 * holds the whole trellis and tracks back from the state termination guarantees, so its answer is
 * the maximum-likelihood path over the frame rather than the survivor of a truncated window.
 *
 * The decoder takes a hard-decision word of bit items or a soft-decision word of one float per
 * coded bit, the sign carrying the bit and the magnitude the confidence. Its branch metric is the
 * correlation sum, so any consistent scaling of the inputs scales the metric and leaves every
 * decision where it was; a demodulator hands over whatever amplitude it has without a
 * normalization step or a quantization table.
 *
 * A Viterbi decoder always answers. The trellis has a best path through any received word, so
 * there is no validity signal to report and nothing is refused. What the result carries instead
 * is the distance between the received word and the winning path re-encoded, which is the
 * decoder's own account, in bits, of what the channel did.

/**
 * A whole-frame maximum-likelihood decoder for one code.
 *
 * The decoder owns its working storage — the branch table, the two path-metric arrays and the
 * survivor decisions of every step — and grows it to the longest frame it has been asked for, so
 * a chain that settles on a frame length stops allocating after its first record.
 *
 * The trellis is walked forward over every step of the frame, each state keeping the better of
 * its two incoming branches. Under `Terminated` the traceback starts from the zero state because
 * termination guarantees the transmitted path ended there; under `Open` it starts from the
 * best-metric final state, the ends being unknown for a record cut out of a continuous stream.
 * No survivor window is applied and no truncation depth is chosen: the whole frame is in hand,
 * so the path traced back is the maximum-likelihood path over it rather than an approximation
 * of one. An open decode's trellis converges after roughly `5K` input steps from no start
 * knowledge, and its last `K-1` information bits lack the future that would resolve them — the
 * two ends a caller sizes its record around.
 *
 * Both entry points want the information span the frame carries, exactly the length
 * `convolutionalInfoBits` names for the received length. A pair of spans that do not describe a
 * frame of this code is answered with a zero result and nothing written, which is the same
 * refusal `convolutionalEncode` makes and for the same reason.
