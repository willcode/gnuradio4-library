/*
 * The generator polynomial of the binary BCH(63,16,23) code is derived from the field, the
 * primitive polynomial and the designed distance, so these tests pin the derivation rather
 * than repeat it. Three independent ways, none of which is the derivation restated:
 *
 *   - the generator divides x^63 - 1, which every cyclic code's generator must and which a
 *     wrong product of minimal polynomials will not;
 *   - the code's minimum distance really is 23, checked by taking the weight of codewords
 *     directly -- for a linear code the minimum weight IS the minimum distance, so this is the
 *     property the correcting power is claimed from and not a proxy for it;
 *   - the resulting polynomial equals the value P25 equipment transmits.
 *
 * Correction is then checked at its exact boundary: every pattern of up to 11 wrong bits must
 * come back as the identifier that was encoded, because that is what distance 23 buys.
