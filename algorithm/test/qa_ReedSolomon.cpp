/*
 * The field, the generator polynomial and the decoder are all built here rather than carried,
 * so these tests pin each layer against something that is not the construction restated.
 *
 *   - the field: alpha has order 63 exactly, and the logarithm and antilogarithm tables are
 *     inverses over every element. A field polynomial that is irreducible but not primitive
 *     passes neither;
 *   - the generator: alpha^1 through alpha^R are roots of it and alpha^(R+1) is not, which is
 *     what fixes both the number of roots and where they start. A generator built for a
 *     different first root produces a code that still encodes and decodes self-consistently
 *     and agrees with nothing else in the world, which is exactly why this is checked;
 *   - the codewords: three parity vectors that an independent implementation of the same
 *     standard produces for the same information. These are the values nothing here measured,
 *     and they pin the field, the generator, the first root and the shortening together.
 *
 * Correction is then checked at its exact boundary and past it. Up to t symbol errors must
 * come back as the block that was encoded. PAST t the decoder may legitimately fail, and it
 * may legitimately land on a different codeword when the received block really is closer to
 * one -- no decoder can do better than that. What it may not do is return a block that is not
 * a codeword at all, or report a correction count that does not match what it changed. Those
 * two are asserted on every trial, at every error weight, because they are the shape a silent
 * wrong answer would take.
 *
 * The three driving instantiations are P25 Phase 1's codes over GF(64) on x^6 + x + 1
 * (TIA-102.BAAA), reached through the ReedSolomon6 alias:
 *
 *   ReedSolomon6<12>  RS(24,12,13)  corrects 6   Link Control, in a voice frame carrying it
 *   ReedSolomon6<8>   RS(24,16,9)   corrects 4   Encryption Sync, in a voice frame carrying it
 *   ReedSolomon6<16>  RS(36,20,17) corrects 8   the header that opens a transmission
