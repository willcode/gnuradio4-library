/*
 * Both shortened Hamming codes are described entirely by their lists of parity columns, so
 * these tests pin the columns and then pin what the columns imply.
 *
 * The two codes behave differently at their limit and the difference is the point.
 * Hamming(15,11,3) is perfect: its fifteen nonzero syndromes name its fifteen bit positions,
 * nothing is left over, and two errors are therefore turned silently into some other single
 * error. Hamming(10,6,3) uses only ten of those fifteen syndromes, so the other five are
 * proof of two or more errors and are reported. Both facts are asserted here by enumeration
 * rather than assumed, because a column list that drifted would change which of them holds.
